**Revolutionizing the student experience at UMT with an AI-powered platform!** CampusConnect integrates a student portal, LMS, and intelligent chatbot, centralizing academic resources and providing personalized support, instant information, and proactive reminders.  Initially a web application, with future Android app development planned.

## üöÄ Project Overview

CampusConnect aims to address the challenges students face navigating complex university systems. By creating a centralized, AI-powered platform, we streamline the student experience at the University of Management and Technology (UMT), Lahore, Pakistan.

This platform integrates:

* **Student Portal:**  A unified access point for essential academic resources and campus information.
* **Learning Management System (LMS) Integration:** Seamlessly connects with existing LMS (like Moodle at UMT) to provide course materials, assignments, grades, and more.
* **Intelligent Chatbot:** An AI-powered assistant to provide personalized support, answer frequently asked questions, offer recommendations, and guide students through various processes.

**Key Goals:**

* Improve student organization and efficiency.
* Enhance communication between students, faculty, and administration.
* Provide personalized support and guidance.
* Increase student engagement and academic performance.
* Reduce administrative overhead.
